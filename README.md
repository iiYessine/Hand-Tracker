# 🖐️ Real-Time Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe

## 📌 Overview

This project implements real-time hand tracking using a webcam.  
It detects and tracks 21 hand landmarks per hand and draws connections between them in real time.

The project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques.
